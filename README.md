# Gagspeak-Converter
Simple HTML+JS based gagspeak converter.

A little background, so this is a little tool to convert words into gagspeak. The original version was made in SWF format by [Veroom (deviantart)](https://www.deviantart.com/veroom), and can still be downloaded on [his page here](https://www.deviantart.com/veroom/art/Gagspeak-Converter-739520813). I just rewrote it into HTML+Javascript, because it's getting harder to run SWF file after most support for Flash player had been stopped in early 2021.

## How to use

Just download "gagspeak.html" and it can be opened on any browser. It works with three types of gag (filling, covering and ring), has a button to copy the converted text to your clipboard.

It was tested and worked in most current version browser of Chrome, Edge and Mozilla.

## A Bit Disclaimer

Bare in mind that this is really bare bones. I didn't beautifully make it at all :ashamed: No icons, just text. Feel free to download and use it to your content, or even modified it and use it for anything else. Please do ask and credit [Veroom](https://www.deviantart.com/veroom) as the original creator if you'd like to use the logic in any commercial setting.
